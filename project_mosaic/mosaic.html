              <h2>Mosaic</h2>
              <p> In summer 2018 I worked as an UI/UX intern at TeleTracking Technologies, a company that makes patient flow software for hospitals. My main project was <b>enhancing the Mosaic design system</b> used within TeleTracking. Mosaic was still in its infancy, which is why I was tasked with researching the undeveloped parts of the design system and fleshing them out. My main deliverable was a <b>style and reference guide</b> used to help the design team deliver consistent product experiences across the whole product suite. </p>

              <h3>Why Design Systems</h3>
              <p>To understand the problem space, I first did a lot of research on design systems and the problems they solve. I reviewed past research done by the design team on the benefits of design systems. I also read Brad Frost’s <a href="http://atomicdesign.bradfrost.com/table-of-contents/">Atomic Design</a>.</p>
              <img src="why-ds-01.jpg"></img>
              <p>I also looked at different design systems used by other companies to get an idea of what content they covered and how they were organized.</p>

              <h3>Discovering Pain Points</h3>
              <p>To find parts of the design system that needed the most work, I conducted interviews with 10 different stakeholders across the company, including representatives from engineering, product management, design, documentation, and QA. Based on how many times each issue came up, I plotted a difficulty-priority matrix to organize the hierarchy of pain points.</p>
              <img src="matrix.png"></img>
              <p>Because this resource mainly involved the design team, I conducted many follow up interviews with designers when digging into the specific parts of the design system.</p>

              <h5>Voice and Tone</h5>
              <h3>Research, Interviews, and Workshops</h3>
              <p>I first tackled Voice & Tone because a lot of the other important parts of the system depended on voice & tone. One pain point was that messaging written across the platform was not consistent  because the UX team doesn’t have a copy writer or any defined standards regarding messaging. Using the testing environments, I looked at the products today and found a lot of inconsistent messaging.</p>
              <img src="messaging-02.png"></img>
              <p class="caption">Examples of inconsistent and confusing messaging- what does turn-key analytics even mean? How do I contact my administrator? Why are the password requirements so long? We needed Voice & Tone guidelines to combat the confusing messaging across the platform.</p>
              <p>I referenced existing Voice & Tone guides and found that there are a multitude of different scopes that these guides can cover. Some guides go into the very technical details of how to phrase language.  I looked at the themes across the different guides and organized them into three categories: Principles, Do’s and Don’ts, and Examples.</p>
              <img src="board1.jpg"></img>
              <p class="caption">I organized the different parts of Voice and Tone guides into three categories</p>
              <img src="board2.jpg"></img>
              <p class="caption">The UX team looked over the examples and talked through which parts were a better fit for what the team needed.</p>
              <h3>Design Challenges</h3>
              <ol>
                <li>Because messaging across the platform was inconsistent, I had to decide which examples to use as exemplars in the design system. I decided through interviewing the team and looking at UX best practices.</li>
                <li>The team had to come to a consensus on voice and tone principles. Anna had already started working on them, but we had to revisit them and get everyone on the same page. I gathered examples of each principle and also held a discussion on which principles to replace or remove.</li>
              </ol>
              <p>After I finished the content for the Voice & Tone guide, I moved on to design. I made sketches before transitioning to digital mockups and prototypes, going through many iterations before settling on a final design.</p>
              <h3>Error Messaging</h3>
              <p>After Voice and Tone principles were established, I moved on to compile error messaging standards. I made an affinity diagram of different types of errors. Using this diagram, I created a hierarchy to organize errors and also map out the page layout of the error messaging. The primary distinction I used was system versus user error, because that distinction helped guide the tone of the messaging.</p>
