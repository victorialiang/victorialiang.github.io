              <h5>introduction</h5>
              <h2>412 Food Rescue Social Project</h2>
              <p> In the second semester of my junior year, I joined the nonprofit 412 Food Rescue as a part-time Product Design Intern. 412 Food Rescue’s mission is to prevent food waste through redirecting perfectly good food that might go to landfills to those who are hungry.</p>

               <p>Food Rescue Coordinators at 412 Food Rescue take calls from food donors like grocery stores and caterers. They then match the food donation to nonprofits in need like food banks and housing developments. A food "rescue" is published to 412 Food Rescue's mobile app. Then, it's up to volunteers to sign up to take these rescues and help transport leftover food.
              </p>

              <p>

              During my 10 weeks, I worked on three projects: a UX review, creating a design system, and a social project. My primary focus was this social project.

              <h3>How might we organically recruit and retain volunteers?</h3>
              
              <p>412 Food Rescue was started in Pittsburgh, but hopes to expand to 20 cities by 2020. Currently, volunteer recruitment is only done through marketing efforts. In new cities where the organization hopes to expand, less manpower can be devoted to marketing. In new cities, we also assumed that a feeling of community could also help with volunteer retention. I designed and explored new features to promote both organic volunteer growth and retention.
              </p>
            
              <h5>Deliverable</h5>
              <p>For my final deliverable, I prototyped and presented 3 different concepts to encourage organic volunteer growth and retention.</p>

              <h3>Side-by-sides</h3>
              <p>I sat with a food recovery call agent for a day to gain empathy on their side of the food rescue experience. I also took some calls and matched up some donors with nonprofits.</p>

              <p>I also took a food rescue in Pittsburgh with my PM and engaged in the food rescue volunteer experience of using the app to transport food from a donor to a nonprofit.</p>

              <h3>Rose-Bud-Thorn</h3>
              
              <p>Previously, 412 Food Rescue had conducted an ideation workshop with industry leaders and volunteers to brainstorm concepts for organic growth and retention. I reviewed these concepts and also came up with a few of my own.
              </p>

              <img src="rbt.jpg"></img>

              <p>I worked with my Product Manager, Anthony, to Rose-Bud-Thorn the proposed concepts. This helped me pull out the most promising ideas based on the concentration of roses and buds.</p>

              <h3>Storyboards</h3>
              <p>I first wrote out some scenarios involving personas. I then sketched out storyboards for how the proposed concepts could pan out.</p>

              <h3>Lean UX Hypotheses</h3>
              <p>I worked with Anthony to write a set of lean UX hypotheses and metrics that we could use to validate whether the concept designs met our goals. </p>

              <!-- <h5>Iteration</h5> -->
              <h3>Wireframes</h3>
              <p>I started by mapping out the steps to the "Bring a Friend" concept. Volunteers can either be single-time volunteers or "weekly rescuers", which means they take one set rescue every week at the same time. I decided to scope down "Bring a Friend" to weekly rescuers because these volunteers would likely be more invested in helping out the volunteer base and also have less trouble coordinating a time to meet up with their friend.</p>

              <img src="mapping.png"></img>

              <p>I made lo-fi wireframe sketches of the different concepts.</p>

              <img src="bring-a-friend-1.png"></img>
              <img src="bring-a-friend-2.png"></img>
              <p class="caption">Bring a Friend Iterations</p>

              <p>Anthony started testing the concept storyboards and lo-fi wireframes with the 412 Food Rescue team, volunteers who walked into the office, and a corporate partner. We gained a few insights on the design concepts.</p>

              <h3>Insights</h3>
              <h4>Corporate Challenge</h4>
              <ul class="browser-default">
                <li>Companies typically like to devote a select amount of time (eg. 1 day) to volunteering. The Corporate Challenge idea was compelling because companies are always looking for ways to get involved with the community, but our corporate partners felt like there should be some cap on time to make it feel more feasible.</li>
                <li>Some sort of dashboard on the company’s side could help the company’s HR team better track the rescues and progress toward the goal.</li>
                <li>Users felt like they would be more likely to take part in the challenge if they were invited by their friends within the company, rather than by the HR team</li>
              </ul>

              <h4>Bring a Friend</h4>
              <ul class="browser-default">
                <li>Users thought that clicking through the 4 steps of onboarding felt tedious</li>
                <li>Users felt that they would prefer to text their friends themselves, rather than use the app. There was confusion over who the sender of the text was- is it 412 Food Rescue or is the volunteer?</li>
                <li>A Food Rescue Coordinator proposed a simpler version of Bring a Friend, which just involved asking volunteers to refer friends that they thought may be interested in downloading the app. This way, volunteers wouldn’t have to go through the trouble of scheduling to meet up with their friend. My PM and I discussed this idea and decided to go forward with prototyping it as “<b>Simple Share</b>”.</li>

              <h3>Corporate Challenge</h3>
              <img src="ccits2.png"></img>

              <p>One goal I had when creating iterations was to create a soft, friendly feeling that was more emotional rather than transactional. My PM described that the social features should feel “like a hug”.</p>

              <p>I looked at our marketing content to try to carry over some of the ways they phrased things to make the app feel more friendly ("Great to see you again!"). I tried to incorporate friendly voice and tone and the use of emojis to make the experience feel more playful.</p>

              <p>I also gave users the ability to invite volunteers within their org based on the company email address. I added a cap on the length of the challenge so that it felt like there was a distinct ending point to the challenge.</p>
              
              <h3>Bring a Friend</h3>
              <img src="bafits.png"></img>

              <p>I focused on simplifying the onboarding steps and making them more useful. Visually, I thought about incorporating illustrations to create a warmer feeling.</p>

              <h5>Reflection</h5>
              <h3>Next Steps</h3>
              <p>After my internship ended, concept testing was still in progress. If I were to continue working with this nonprofit, I would review the data collected from testing against the metrics from the Lean UX hypotheses we created to validate if these concepts meet our goals of organic volunteer growth and retention.</p>

              <p>If we do validate that these concepts should be carried out further, I would like to prototype a more holistic experience involving the touchpoints from both ends. In the interest of time I only prototyped what the experience would look like from the volunteer's side. I would also like to dig deeper into what a dashboard for the corporate challenge could look like and what the volunteer's invited friend's experience would look like.</p>

              <h3>Takeaways</h3>
              <p>It felt very rewarding to work for a cause that I feel passionate about. I also enjoyed having this new experience of working at a small startup where I was the only designer, and had the opportunity to work closely with product and real users of the application.</p>
